## ‚ú® What is Boycott Beacon?

Boycott Beacon is a **free and open-source browser extension** designed to empower users by providing timely information about boycott campaigns directly within their browser. When you visit a website targeted by a campaign you follow, Boycott Beacon displays a discreet alert.

**Key Principles:**

*   üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy First:** All checks happen *locally* in your browser. Your browsing history and subscriptions are never sent to any server.
*   ‚úä **User Control:** You choose which boycott campaign lists (manifests) to subscribe to.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Transparency:** Both the extension and this website are fully open-source.
