## ‚ú® What is Boycott Beacon?

Boycott Beacon is a **free and open-source browser extension** designed to empower users by providing timely information about boycott campaigns directly within their browser. When you visit a website targeted by a campaign you follow, Boycott Beacon displays a discreet alert.

**Key Principles:**

*   üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy First:** All checks happen *locally* in your browser. Your browsing history and subscriptions are never sent to any server.
*   ‚úä **User Control:** You choose which boycott campaign lists (manifests) to subscribe to.
*   ÈÄèÊòé **Transparency:** Both the extension and this website are fully open-source.

## üöÄ Our Projects

This organization hosts the core components of the Boycott Beacon project:

*   **[üìå boycott-beacon](https://github.com/neural-loop/boycott-beacon)**: The main browser extension source code. Find installation instructions and report extension-specific issues here.
*   **[üåê boycott-beacon-website](https://github.com/neural-loop/boycott-beacon-website)**: The source code for our official website ([boycottbeacon.org]([YOUR_WEBSITE_URL_HERE])), built with Hugo. Find website content and report website issues here.
*   **(Optional) [üìä boycott-beacon-campaigns](https://github.com/neural-loop/boycott-beacon-campaigns)**: Repository hosting example or official campaign manifest files (`campaign.json`). *(<< Add this if you create a separate repo for manifests)*
